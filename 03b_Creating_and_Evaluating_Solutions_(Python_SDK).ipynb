    "* **mean_reciprocal_rank_at_25**: The [mean of the reciprocal ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank) of the first relevant recommendation out of the top 25 recommendations over all queries. This metric is appropriate if you're interested in the single highest ranked recommendation.\n",
    "* **normalized_discounted_cumulative_gain_at_K**: Discounted gain assumes that recommendations lower on a list of recommendations are less relevant than higher recommendations. Therefore, each recommendation is discounted (given a lower weight) by a factor dependent on its position. To produce the [cumulative discounted gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain) (DCG) at K, each relevant discounted recommendation in the top K recommendations is summed together. The normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) is the DCG divided by the ideal DCG such that NDCG is between 0 - 1. (The ideal DCG is where the top K recommendations are sorted by relevance.) Amazon Personalize uses a weighting factor of 1/log(1 + position), where the top of the list is position 1. This metric rewards relevant items that appear near the top of the list, because the top of a list usually draws more attention.\n",

    "## Using Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "It's tempting to over-focus on these evaluation metrics, but very important to consider the bigger picture:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In recommendation problems, there is a **strong feedback loop** that **favours the existing deployed system**: People don't click/purchase items they don't see, so the historical interaction data we train from is influenced by the biases of the previously deployed system(s).\n",
    "* This 'offline' validation procedure doesn't have any knowledge of **input item lists** you might supply to re-ranking models, or **filter rules** you may apply to models in general... Which might have significant impact on real-world deployed performance by filtering out known-irrelevant items (or accidentally removing important items!)\n",
    "* **Cold starting** of new items is difficult to evaluate using these metrics. The aim of cold-starting strategies is to recommend items which are new to your business. Therefore, these items will not appear in the existing user transaction data which is used to compute the evaluation metrics!\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping in mind these factors, the evaluation metrics produced by Personalize are generally useful for two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Comparing the performance of solution versions trained on the same recipe, but with different values for the hyperparameters and features (impression data etc)\n",
    "1. Comparing the performance of solution versions trained on different recipes (except HRNN Coldstart).\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly evaluating a recommendation system is always best done through **A/B testing** while measuring **actual business outcomes**. Since recommendations generated by a system usually influence the user behavior which it is based on, it is better to run small experiments and apply A/B testing for **longer periods of time**. Over time, the bias from the existing model will fade."

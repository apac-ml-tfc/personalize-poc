This service, like many within AWS, will automatically scale based on demand, but if latency is critical, you may want to provision ahead for larger demand. For this POC and demo, all minimum throughput thresholds are set to 1. For more information, see the [pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/).\n",
